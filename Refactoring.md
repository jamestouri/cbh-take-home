# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here
I cleaned up the method of creating a hash that was used twice and got rid of certain conditionals such as checking if candidate is not null and immediately gave it the TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY value. Since the method was working prior to the refactoring I ran it with the expected values to use for my tests which go through every scenario, which checks if the partition key is under 256 characters, over 256 characters, or if the partitionKey key isn't available.
